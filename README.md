Playing with useState and useEffect and how they can be used with RxJS

I did a contrived counter and implemented it using just "plain js"? and useState and also using rxjs as a comparisson to help get my head around things.

**NOTE:** I need to separate the two implementations because at the moment they are on top of each other and the rxjs stuff could use a bit of clearing up to make it more readable.

## What it includes

* increment
* decrement
* auto increment every second
* reset
* persist count to local storage
